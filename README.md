<h1>Laravel CRUD Overview</h1><br>
<p>Laravel CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is a fundamental concept in web development that refers to the basic operations performed on data in a database. In Laravel, a popular PHP web framework, CRUD operations are used to manage data in a database table.
</p>
<h3>What is CRUD?</h3>
<li><b>Create (C):</b> This operation is used to add new data to the database table.</li>
<li><b>Read (R):</b> This operation is used to retrieve data from the database table.</li>
<li><b>Update (U):</b> This operation is used to modify existing data in the database table.</li>
<li><b>Delete (D):</b> This operation is used to delete data from the database table.</li><br>
<h3>Laravel CRUD Example</h3>

Here's a simple example of how CRUD operations can be implemented in Laravel:

<h4>Create</h4>
<li>Create a new resource (e.g., a user) by sending a POST request to the /users endpoint.</li>
<li>The request body should contain the data to be created (e.g., name, email, password).</li><br>

<h4>Read</h4>
<li>Retrieve a list of all resources (e.g., all users) by sending a GET request to the /users endpoint.</li>
<li>Retrieve a single resource (e.g., a specific user) by sending a GET request to the /users/{id} endpoint.</li><br>

<h4>Update</h4>
<li>Update an existing resource (e.g., a user) by sending a PUT or PATCH request to the /users/{id} endpoint.</li>
<li>The request body should contain the updated data.</li><br>

<h4>Delete</h4>
<li>Delete a resource (e.g., a user) by sending a DELETE request to the /users/{id} endpoint.</li><br>

<h3>Laravel CRUD Implementation</h3>
In Laravel, CRUD operations can be implemented using the following steps:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Create a new controller (e.g., UserController) to handle CRUD operations.
<li>Define the routes for CRUD operations in the routes/web.php file.
<li>Use Eloquent, Laravel's ORM, to interact with the database.
<li>Implement the CRUD operations in the controller methods.
</ol>
